- clean up code generators
- extract and provide as docstrings more of the sollya help
- install a message callback? (that would result in Python warnings?)
- bind decompose_externalprocedure & friends?
- test!
- better support multiple precision integers, floats, intervals...
  (perhaps only in cooperation with sage?)
- bind evaluate_function_at_constant_expression, providing Python access to the
  flags it returns
- provide Python bindings for the versions of externalproc() etc. that dlopen()
  a file???
- valgrind
- support min([a, b, c]), plot([f, g], ...), etc.?
