- clean up code generators
- extract and provide as docstrings more of the sollya help
- install a message callback? (that would result in Python warnings?)
- bind decompose_externalprocedure & friends?
- test!
- wrap libraryfunction (similar to externalproc, with sollya obj as in/out)
- better support multiple precision integers, floats, intervals...
  (perhaps only in cooperation with sage?)
- bind evaluate_function_at_constant_expression, providing Python access to the
  flags it returns
- provide Python bindings for the versions of externalproc() etc. that dlopen()
  a file???
- valgrind
