REQUIREMENTS:

As of pythonsollya 0.4.0:

- Cython (tested with 0.24.1)
- Sollya (master, tested with weekly http://sollya.gforge.inria.fr/sollya-weekly-09-23-2019.tar.gz)
- SageMath (optional, tested with 7.4.rc0)
- bigfloat (tested with 0.4.0)

(The development branch of pythonsollya may require more recent versions.)

SETUP

- Installing via pip using something like

    $ pip install git+https://gitlab.com/metalibm-dev/pythonsollya

  should work, provided that a suitable version of Sollya can be found in a
  standard location on the system.

- Manual build and installation, use PYTHON and PIP variable to change between python2/python3 install, and WITH_EXTERNALDATA to enable support of Sollya's externaldata feature:

    $ make [SOLLYA_DIR=/sollya/installation/directory] [PYTHON=python3 PIP=pip3] [WITH_EXTERNALDATA=yes]
    $ make install [PREFIX=/destination/] [PYTHON=python3 PIP=pip3]

- To build sagesollya (= pythonsollya + SageMath support), use

    $ make sagesollya.so [SOLLYA_DIR=/sollya/installation/directory] \
                         [SAGE=/path/to/sage/executable]

  (see also TROUBLESHOOTING below).

USAGE:

There is no real user manual (yet?), but see the examples/ directory for
some usage examples. Most functions behave like their interactive Sollya
counterparts.

TROUBLESHOOTING & MISCELLANEOUS NOTES:

- Using PythonSollya with Sollya plugins

  When loaded from Sollya, plugins such as externalprocs and libraryfunctions
  can call libsollya functions without having to link to libsollya. Under
  PythonSollya, however, libsollya symbols typically are not accessible to
  shared libraries loaded after the sollya module is imported. To make Sollya
  plugins that call into libsollya work with PythonSollya, please either
  explicitly link to libsollya when compiling the plugin, or force Python to
  load PythonSollya with global symbol visibility, using something like:

    import sys, DLFCN
    sys.setdlopenflags(DLFCN.RTLD_NOW | DLFCN.RTLD_GLOBAL)
    import sollya

  See dlopen(3) for more information.

- Using Sage packages provided by Linux distributions

  Depending how your distribution packages SageMath, you may need header files
  not installed by default to build sagesollya using your distribution's
  packages. For example, Debian users need to install the libpari-dev package in
  addition to sagemath.

- Sagesollya fails to build even with a version of Sage built from source

  Building external packages that link against Sage was broken for a while
  (around Sage 8.0-8.1) due to Sage bug #24987. Try upgrading to Sage 8.2 or
  later.

- In python2 sollya can not execute unbounded methods properly
