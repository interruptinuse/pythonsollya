LICENSE

  This software is distributed under the CECILL-C V2.1 license
as detailed in the LICENSE file

REQUIREMENTS:

- Cython (tested with 0.24.1)
- Sollya >= git 95b6c220cf3967c9fddd01f48c8cbef1df5a5d2b
- SageMath (optional, tested with 7.4.rc0)

INSTALLATION:

    $ make [SOLLYA_DIR=/sollya/installation/directory]
    $ make install [PREFIX=/destination/]

Note that the build scripts are quite fragile. For now, they will automatically
try to detect if SageMath (Sage) is available (in the Python search path), and
build PythonSollya with Sage support if possible. Thus, with a typical setup,

    $ make [SOLLYA_DIR=/sollya/installation/directory]

will build pure Python bindings, while

    $ sage -sh -c "make SOLLYA_DIR=$HOME/opt/sollya"

will build Python+Sage bindings.

USAGE:

There is no real user manual (yet?), but see the examples/ directory for
some usage examples. Most functions behave like their interactive Sollya
counterparts.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES:

- Using PythonSollya with Sollya plugins

  When loaded from Sollya, plugins such as externalprocs and libraryfunctions
  can call libsollya functions without having to link to libsollya. Under
  PythonSollya, however, libsollya symbols typically are not accessible to
  shared libraries loaded after the sollya module is imported. To make Sollya
  plugins that call into libsollya work with PythonSollya, please either
  explicitly link to libsollya when compiling the plugin, or force Python to
  load PythonSollya with global symbol visibility, using something like:

    import sys, DLFCN
    sys.setdlopenflags(DLFCN.RTLD_NOW | DLFCN.RTLD_GLOBAL)
    import sollya

  See dlopen(3) for more information.
